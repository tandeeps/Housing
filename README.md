# Housing pricing assessment using Advanced Regression
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information

The goal is to construct a model capable of predicting house prices based on the available independent variables. This model is intended for use by the management to gain insights into the precise correlation between prices and various factors. By leveraging this predictive tool, the management can strategically adjust the firm's approach and focus on areas likely to yield substantial returns. Additionally, the model serves as a valuable resource for comprehending the pricing dynamics of a new market, offering valuable insights for informed decision-making.

## Conclusions
Several approaches were undertaken to determine the most suitable model for managing the dataset. We examined Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression models to identify the optimal choice.

The Ridge and Lasso models proved effective, demonstrating their ability to adeptly regularize the models by appropriately handling independent variables. Their regularization techniques contribute to enhanced model performance and effective management of the dataset.
